Here's to all the girls who where told ' you are hard to understand ' , ' you are not easy going ', ' you are confused and make me confused ', ' you are mess' .. Which i know is not true but we don't have that courage to speak up because somewhere inside they made us doubt, is it true??

Here's to one who have it in them to stand up despite it all, and say love is never supposed to be easy, and it's not about i am hard to understand it's about if you really want to understand me or not because what we truly want is very simple not a mess.

We crave respect, to be heard, love and affection which is genuine and not just a formality that's it ...
