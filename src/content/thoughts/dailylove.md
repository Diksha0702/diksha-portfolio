Showing people you care or love them is becoming clichès but I think it's important in love.
I mean all kinds of love out there. It can be two friends reaching out for each other every here and there, or lover reminding you to do the your daily routine of water and food on time just because. It's your father bringing you your favourite food just because he saw on his way and it's in the way your mother still tells you to lock the door when ur home alone. There will never be enough stories about hugs and impromptu dates with the one u love. There is a smile on your face every time u see your favourite person in love.
I believe where else the love reside if not in the ordinary things, where else is home if not in the moments that can be relieved all over again?
