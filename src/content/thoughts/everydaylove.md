But that's me ..
Cause for me LOVE is like those small little things ..
When my mom cooks my favourite food just because i had a tough day ...
When my best friend keeps sending reels as gesture to keep checking on me...
When the moon and i have those heart to heart conversation..
When my brother stays out with me late at night so i can be safe and have fun at same time...
When its a lazy morning and i just want is a home made coffee to make it perfect....
When my father just come to me pat my head and hug me at regular intervals....
When someone cares more than you about you eating on time and reaching safely...
When it rains and I just want to lose myself in the sound, smell or every thing about it...
When its the sky which makes those beautiful painting together with sun and clouds....
When those two fictional character I watch or read about have a meet cute and just fall in love with each other
But yaa that's just My way of feeling that I am lovedÂ enough....
