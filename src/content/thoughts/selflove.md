We all are stuck between
" I did everything I could to show them i love them" &
" I'm tried of fighting for someone who doesn't put in the same efforts back"

And that's when i realised why it's equally important to put in efforts on yourself so you could also feel
" I did everything and i would love to fight but I love myself a lot more and i won't compromise myself in this process"
